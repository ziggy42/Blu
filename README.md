Blum wants to be a simple Android Twitter Client, with a clean UI and without thousands of unnecessary options.
Available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andreapivetta.blu).

### How to run the app

In order to test the application, you need to [setup a new twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com/). Then edit your gradle.properties file to look like this:
```
CallBackUrl="callback url"
ConsumerKey="consumer key"
ConsumerSecret="consumer secret"
```
